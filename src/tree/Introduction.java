Binary tree : two or less than two children

1. Full binary tree : either 0 child or 2 child

2. Perfect binary tree: every node have tow child except leaf

3. Complete binary tree: last node can have one child, one leaf missing

4. Degenerate/pathological binary tree: all node have one child

5. Skewed binary tree:
    Left Skewed binary tree
    Right Skewed binary tree

6. Balance binary tree: all leaf at eithr lever 0 or level 1
